My name is Ypatios Chaniotakos. Currently I work as a waiter (but not for too long). My passion for programming has set the stage for me to pursue a carreer as a software engineer.
Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain are the most exciting fields of study and I really hope I can dive deep into these concepts professionally.
My hobbies are running, lifting some weights, studying the markets for some trading here and there and also spending time with my loved ones.
I love dad jokes, and I also love responding with a pun.
